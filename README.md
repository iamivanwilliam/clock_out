Clock Out: Time Management App
Introduction
Clock Out is a simple, interactive Python application designed to help users track the hours spent on various activities, such as hobbies or work. Whether you're dedicating time to a project, studying, or engaging in a hobby like working on a motorcycle, Clock Out offers a straightforward way to manage and record the time you've invested.

Features
Simple Input: Users can easily clock in and out by entering the time in HH:MM format.
Time Validation: Ensures that the entered times are in the correct format and logically consistent (e.g., handling entries that span from one day to the next).
Duration Calculation: Automatically calculates the total time spent between the clock in and clock out times, accounting for activities that might extend beyond midnight.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python here.
Installation
Clock Out does not require any external libraries or installations beyond Python itself. Simply clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Running the App
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you've saved the clock_out.py script.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python clock_out.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your clock in and clock out times.
Usage
Upon launching the Clock Out app, you will be prompted to enter the time you started your activity (clocked in) and the time you completed it (clocked out). Please enter the times in a 24-hour format (HH:MM). For example:

Clock in time: 10:30
Clock out time: 16:45
After entering both times, the app will calculate and display the total duration you spent on the activity, providing a clear breakdown in hours and minutes.
